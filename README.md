# HelloXamarin

The structure and functionality of this code follow the [Xamarin.Forms Quickstarts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/get-started/quickstarts/). The main differences are some names (e. g. a property called `Content` instead of the original `Text`), alternative ways of doing things (e. g. a LINQ expression instead of a `foreach` cycle) and "teaching comments". I believe that tweaking the code from a tutorial (even in trivial ways) instead of blindy copy-pasting it forces me to understand better what am I doing.

If you are working on the Quickstarts, this repo *could* be a little useful.
